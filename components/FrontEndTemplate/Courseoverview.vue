    <h2>Course Description</h2>

    <p>
      Now more than ever, corporations are investing heavily in IT. The quality
      of these investments affects the daily work of millions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet it’s not uncommon to see industry surveys where the failure rates for
      IT projects is over 50%. It’s possible to do better and it’s possible to
      do so consistently. Use the Business Model Canvas to focus your company
      strategy and facilitate buy-in from stakeholders.

      In this two-week course, we’ll step through major challenges within
      corporate IT and how to address them with the disciplined use of design
      thinking, Lean Startup, and agile as a team framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      Translate your work on the Canvas to specific charters in IT. Rapidly
      prototype strategically-aligned processes for implementation within your
      IT infrastructure. How do you define a customer-centric strategy you can
      actually execute? To do strategic IT, you’ve got to have a strategy!
      Ideally, you need one that’s easy to understand and use as a clear basis
      for action.

    <p>That’s what you’ll learn in this course.</p>

    <h2>A Short Description</h2>

    <p>
      A customer-centric way of doing business is a way that provides a positive
      customer experience before and after the sale in order to drive repeat
      business, enhance customer loyalty and improve business growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, a customer-centric company is more than a company that offers good
      service. Both Amazon and Zappos are prime examples of brands that are
      customer-centric and have spent years creating a culture around the
      customer and their needs. Their commitment to delivering customer value is
      genuine – In fact, Zappos is happy to fire employees if they do not fit
      within their customer-centric culture!
    </p>

    <p>
      But, how important is being customer-centric? The good news is that’s
      becoming very important! Econsultancy recently asked what the most
      important characteristic is in order to establish a truly “digital-native”
      culture. The answer to that question and leading the responses with 58%
      was to be customer-centric.
